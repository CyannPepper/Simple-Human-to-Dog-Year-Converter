# Simple-Human-to-Dog-Year-Converter
Simple human to dog year converter made in JavaScript app.js under a Codecademy project.

// variable storing my age
const myAge = 23;
// variable storing early years
let earlyYears = 2;
earlyYears *= 10.5;
// dog years accounted for by first 2 years 
laterYears = myAge - 2;
// dog years accounted for by later years
laterYears *= 4;
// adds early and later years to get total dog years
myAgeInDogYears = earlyYears + laterYears;
// Stores my name in lowercase letters
let myName = 'Pepper';
myName.toLowerCase();
// Displays your name and age in dog years
console.log('My name is ' + myName + '. I am ' + myAge + ' years old in human years which is ' + myAgeInDogYears + ' years old in dog years.');
